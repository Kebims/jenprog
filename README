= Jenprog - simple bootloader for jennic chips =

 Jenprog is a command line driven bootloader for jennic Wireless
Microcontrollers. It supports bootloading through serial interfaces and over
ipv6. Furthermore it has a special mode for Ftdi-Chip Serial chip designs.

== Installation ==

== Usage ==

Usage: jenprog [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ADDR, --address=ADDR
                        start reading at address
  -l LEN, --len=LEN     number of bytes to read
  -m MAC, --mac=MAC     reset the mac addr
  -k KEY, --key=KEY     reset the license key
  -v, --verbose         print send and received packets
  -y, --verify          also verify after writing
  -s, --show            show mac address and license key
  -e, --erase           erasing the flash after reading mac and license key
  -c CONN, --connection=CONN
                        connection implementation (serial,ipv6,ftdi) [default:
                        serial]
  -t TARGET, --target=TARGET
                        target for connection

  Calling jenprog without any file argument will read the contents of the flash
to standard output. Calling it with a file argument will delete the flash and
reprogram with the supplied file.

WORD OF CAUTION:
 * be sure to read your licence key and mac address prior to any attempt to
   reprogram the jennic as it will be deleted and reprogrammed every cycle. So
   if your programming is stopped half-way mac and license key will be lost!
 * there are no sanity on the file itself, jenprog will happily write crap to
   jennics flash memory.

=== Putting the Jennic module into programming mode ===

  On certain type of boards you have to put the module into programming mode,
prior to reprogramming the moduls. On the jennic demokit boards this is done by
pressing 'reset' and 'program' together and releasing the 'reset' button prior
to the 'program' button.

  When programming over the ipv6 connection this is not needed as this will be
done automatically.

=== Configuring connection ===

  Jenprog supports three way of connecting to your device. Through serial ports,
ipv6 and through ftdi chips. The Type of connection is determined by the '-c'
parameter. The target parameter depends on the chosen connection. For serial
connection this is the serial port to use, for ipv6 this is the ip-address of
your device, for ftdi-based connections there is no target. Serial connection is
the default, for example to program through the second USB serial connector, you
could use:

 $ jenprog -c /dev/ttyUSB1 <program-file.hex>
 0%..10%..20%..30%..40%..50%..60%..70%..80%..90%..done - 2.55 kb/s - writing mac address and key..done

=== Showing/Resetting the mac address and license key ===

 Jennic modules store their ieee802.15.4 mac address in a special region in the
flash. Futhermore the license key for their Zigbee stack can also be found
there. To show them you need to put the Jennic module into programming mode.
Afterwards call jenprog with your configuration with '-s' parameter. For example
over ipv6:

 $ jenprog -c ipv6 -t <ip-address> -s
 flash: ST M25P10-A
 mac: 0x00158d0000058448 license: 0x000000000000000000000

which will output the type of flash this module includes, its mac address and
its license key.
